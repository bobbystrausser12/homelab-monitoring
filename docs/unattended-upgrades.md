Unattended Security Upgrades

To keep my system patched without manual intervention, I enabled Ubuntu’s unattended-upgrades package. This service automatically installs important security updates and protects the OS from known vulnerabilities.

I also configured periodic package downloads and enabled email/console logging. Automatic security updates are a standard best practice for Linux servers and reduce the chance of missing a critical patch.
